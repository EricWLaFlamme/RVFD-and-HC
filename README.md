# RVFD + HC: Foundational Framework and Authorship Claim

This repository contains the original authored and timestamped declaration of:

- **Ruliad Vibration Field Dynamics (RVFD)**
- **Holographic Calculus (HC)**
- **The Prime Modulation Constant \( \chi \)**

These frameworks establish a deterministic, prime-indexed vibrational model of reality. From this structure, all known physical constants are derived, including the introduction of a new constant: \( \chi \).
