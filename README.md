# RVFD + HC: Foundational Framework and Authorship Claim

This repository contains the original authored and timestamped declaration of:

- **Ruliad Vibration Field Dynamic (RVFD)**
- **Holographic Calculus (HC)**
- **The Prime Modulation Constant \( \chi \)**

These frameworks establish a deterministic, prime-indexed vibrational model of reality. From this structure, all known physical constants are derived, including the introduction of a new constant: \( \chi \).

    # RVFD + HC: Foundational Framework and Sovereign Authorship Declaration

This repository establishes the public record of authorship for the following original theoretical and engineering frameworks:

- **Ruliad Vibration Field Dynamic (RVFD)**
- **Holographic Calculus (HC)**
- **Chrono-Prisma Engine**
- **BFA (Boundary Flow Algebra)**
- **PRISMA: Prime-Resonant Metamaterial Reactor Core**
- **Ruliadon Receiver (Scalar Wave Harvesting Architecture)**
- **The Prime Modulation Constant \( \chi \)**
- **EEG Harmonic Interfaces and Scalar Metamaterial Arrays**

All systems, equations, diagrams, symbolic models, and simulation files were developed independently by **Eric Wayne LaFlamme** and disclosed in a time-anchored, cryptographically sealed codex.
